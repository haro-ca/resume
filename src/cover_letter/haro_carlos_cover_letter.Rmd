### Data scientist with experience in economic analysis <br>  Currently searching for a data science position.

Main focus on visualization and data pipelines for production delivery. <br><br>

### *Who am I?*
A data scientist and an economist fascinated by how
data science projects add value to an industry/organization.<br>
My answer, so far, is: by creating products and services that simplify, efficiently process, and
clearly communicate complex data.<br>
**Simplification**: In my experience, this isn't necessarily done by means of a model
(in fact, in my current organization, the answer rarely is a model);
a visualization, or a well written API can be just as effective.<br>
**Efficiency**: An efficient data solution is one that solves the problem with the least amount 
of resources, in this (...)
Example: a pipeline that starts at the DB Storage,
iterates through feature design and proper visualization,
proceeds the model training, and deploys into a containerized service with a RESTful API;
all of this, linked through multiple triggers.
(This can be further expanded: proper logging, unit testing, CI/CD, and much more.)
I find simplication a common task among data scientists/analysts; efficiency, on the other hand,
is something I've seen most frequent in engineers (ML engineers, DevOps).<br>
My interest lies in this intersection, and I'm looking for a role that allows me to
develop both of them.

### *Experience and skillset*
<div class='pull-left'>
[*Outliers*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)),
a book by [Malcolm Gladwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell), states that 
mastery over a skill can only be achieved by 10,000 hours of productive work.
While there is both evidence in favor and against this theory, I do find it a good proxy for
maturity of a skillset. The chart intents to summarize my current progress.
