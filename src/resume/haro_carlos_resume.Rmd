## Skills {#skills}

[*Outliers*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)), by [Malcolm Gladwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell), states that mastery over a skill can only be achieved by 10,000 hours of productive work. I find it a good proxy for maturity of a skillset, so I summarize my current state in the charts below:<br>

**Programming (hours of work)**<br>
```{r, background="transparent"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('logo', 'gladwell.png'))
```

**Statistics**<br>
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('logo', 'gladwell_statistics.png'))
```

Main experience with frequentist methods, but with high interest to develop in bayesian's.

**Fun facts**<br> Vim enthusiast; in the terminal, in VScode, in RStudio, in Chrome (with Vimium), even in the whole OS! (with Karabiner)\
Chess fanatic [(chess.com profile)](https://www.chess.com/member/mendel17)  
Salsa dancer (though not while COVID)
